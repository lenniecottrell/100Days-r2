  <summary>Day 13: June 10, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - I looked at LeetCode #237 on linked lists. I reviewed a couple of solutions after thinking about it for a while and made sure I understood the solutions before moving on.
  - Started working on LeetCode #141 also. I got close! my initial attempt passed some of the test cases but didn't pass submission. I'll take one more crack at it before looking up solutions.
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - finish this problem
  - keep reading about user auth
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - I'm very proud of myself for beginning to tackle leetcode questions, and actually starting to feel like I understand the basics of DS&A

  <summary>Day 12: June 9, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - I finished building the "My Library" page when its blank - I think I need to implement user authentication before I can populate shelves? Maybe not....
  - Cleaned up some components
  - Started studying how another dev implemented user auth on a simple to do app (he used Redux)
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - I want to keep working on this, but I also want to keep picking away at linked lists. I'm gonna do some review and maybe look at a problem
  - If I have more time I'll keep studying how to do user authentication
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - I am feeling very confident with my CSS/Fundamental React skills. I obviously have a ton to learn still, but it's time to start challenging myself to get outside my comfort zone.
  - Adding user auth will definitely be a challenge!
  - Add redux to this app would also be a very useful challenge

  <summary>Day 11: June 8, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - Today I made some design decions about UI/UX and started implementing them in my book app
  - "My Library" will be its own page with tabs for different shelves
  - Account login is a modal box for now
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - finish building the "My Library" page
  - study how to add authentication
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - I can't stress enough how important and valuable it is to plan before starting to code. Let this be a lesson I drive deep into my brain.

  <summary>Day 10: June 7, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - did some planning for the next pages of my book app
  - Built out the about page
  - Researched some components I want to use for the account page and book detail page
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - Build the account page and book detail page
  - Connect the routes to the new pages
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - Design choices are hard! There are many different ways a design could go, and planning definitely helps but it's hard to know if you're picking a good UI/UX until you actually start using the thing I think.

  <summary>Day 9: June 6, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - attempted to implement a linked list from memory
  - reviewed some of the linked list videos as a refresher
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - don't lose steam on the book app - do some planning
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - false confidence when you're learning is super real. 
  - The concept of a linked list isn't hard to understand, but remembering how to implement it in code is more difficult than I expected
  - Practice more. Maybe look at some problems and solutions to get more context on how to use a linked list?

  <summary>Day 8: June 5, 2022</summary>

  #### Things I accomplished today:
  * standardized the card size and position of the images/text on the cards
  * used a SimpleGrid instead of normal Grid in ChakraUI to make easy breakpoints for the grid
  * added a small hover animation to the cards and a fade in for when they load
  * I started making my routes, and I realized I have more planning to do to figure out what the other pages will look like
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - Start with reviewing what I know about linked lists
  - Introduce the next problem in Cracking the Coding Interview
  - Work on the plan for the additional pages in my book app
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - Working in support has made using documentation way easier. Since I reference our own docs and KB at work, I'm used to the language and how it applies Also, since I just know more about code now, implementing things with the docs makes more sense.

### Week 1 - May 29-June 4, 2022
<details>
  <summary>Day 7: June 4, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - learned about remove(), find(), and peek() methods in linked lists
    - populated my book cards with titles, authors, and images
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - try to write out a linked list in javascript from memory and my notes without referencing the one I already wrote
    - make a working branch on the book app so I don't accidentally ruin the good work I've done :)
    - set breakpoints on the grid
    - standardize the title/author text position
    - add a hover animation to the cards
    - add routes to the other pages and start building them
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - other future to-dos include publishing to github pages, adding authentication
    - I had to deal with what happens when there are no image links, so that was a interesting edge case to have to work around. It wasn't too tricky, but I didn't expect it

</details>

  <summary>Day 6: June 3, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I solved the first problem in Cracking the Coding Interview with a brute force method and O(n^2) time. I looked up other more efficient solutions - time to learn about hash tables!
    - I learned how to implement a queue in Javascript
    - I got to spend some hours building my book app UI with ChakraUI and the google books API. It was good practice to fetch API data and display it with useEffect(). I have a kind of clunky solution at the moment, I'll go back and refactor after I clean up the UI a little bit
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - clean the UI so the cards are all the same size
    - consider a different way to display the book data
    - watch another linked list video
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - I learned a lot about Chakra UI today, and hot damn using a component library really speeds things up. I don't regret all the time I've spent struggling with CSS, but I'm grateful for a component library that can speed up UI development.

  <summary>Day 5: June 2, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - Researched UI libraries a bit more and devcided to change to ChakraUI, started learning about it
    - Started building my component skeleton
    - Watched 2 more Linked List videos about removeFirst() and removeLast()
    - I started working on the first problem from Cracking the Coding Interview. It's a type of question I've seen before, I just need to remember how to do it.
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - I want to start building the UI at least, if not start to import some data
    - finish this algo problem
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - I actually think data structures are super interesting. The videos I'm watching explain everything very clearly and make it seem way easier than I'm sure it is in reality, so I'm excited to start actually applying this stuff to problems.

  <summary>Day 4: June 1, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I started planning the UI for the book app and made a list of the tools I plan to use
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - Another couple of linked list vids
    - Review the linked list implementation in Javascript
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - Planning before coding is good and helpful!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 3: May 31, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - watched some videos about adding to the beginning or adding to the ending of an array
    - I started reviewing the Google Books API docs
    - I started reading Cracking the Coding Interview to get an idea of what's ahead.
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - start sketching out my plans for a personal library app - what are all the parts and pieces, what does the UI look like?
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - I was reminded today as I dove in the deep end of the google books API how much better off I'll be if I spend some time planning before jumping into the code. A solid plan will give me the mental framework and conceptual skeleton I need to be more efficient when I actually start diving in

<details>
  <summary>Day 2: May 30, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I learned about considering boundary conditions in data structures, and adding an element to the beginning of a linked list
    - Reviewed some of the basic of BigO notation
    - I initialized a new app for organizing books using the google boks API
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - more linked list videos
    - dig deeper into the google books API and start building an app
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - the 5 boundary conditions for data structures should be considered regardless of the type od structure:
      - what to do if it's empty
      - what to do if there's a single element
      - how to add/remove from the beginning
      - how to add/remove from the end
      - working in the middle
</details>

  <summary>Day 1: May 29, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I started learning about linked lists
    - I wrote some code to define a linked list in javascript
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - Watch the next lectures on linked lists from SDSU
    - Start looking at leetcode?
  ###### Notes/Learnings:
    - Each node in a lists contains a pointer and data
    - List are always complexity O(n) (technically Theta(n)), because each item always needs to be counted and the time it takes to count them increases linearly with the number of items
    - The nodes in a linked list are stored in separate objects that contain pointers to the next objects in the list. This is different from an array, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations (each location being an increment of 4 bytes)
    - Search operations are slow because nodes are accessed sequentially
    - Uses more memory than arrays because of the pointers
    - Nodes can be more easily manipulated than arrays
