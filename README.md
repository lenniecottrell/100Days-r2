  <summary>Day 99: October 3, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I responded to the Google verification team to clarify what I still need to do. I think this'll happen, I just need to jump through their hoops.

<details>
  <summary>Day 98: October 2, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I recorded a video and submitted Shelf for verification so that the scary warning will go away. Should take a few weeks.
- I had to upload a <meta> tag to Shelf for verification, so far so good

<details>
  <summary>Day 97: October 1, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I successfully got my blog working on a GitHub project page, which is easier than trying to re-shuffle everything around.
- I fixed the image on the blog landing page, which broke the image on the About and Post pages. hmmmm
- At least now lenniecottrell.github.io works and lenniecottrell/github/io/blog works as they should. No more need to pay for web hosting, and once my domain is fully transferred to porkbun then I can remove everything from GoDaddy

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- create my walkthrough video for Google
- Try and fix the image problem
- Start drafting my blog post
- Watch another DSA video

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- take down lenniecottrell.com and lenniewritescode.com?
- ~~figure out what I want to do about my blog/portfolio~~
- create my walkthough video for google verification
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 96: September 28, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Didn't really accomplish much per se, but I learned some things.
- The Jekyll blog is really designed to be on a user page, not a project page (`lenniecottrell.github.io`, not `lenniecottrell.github.io/blog`). There's clearly a way to do it, but I can't find any resources that explain it.
- This is why my posts weren't updating and why the image on the main page wasn't loading.
- I guess I could make my portfolio site a project page, make the blog my user page, and customize the domain for my portfolio site since I was going to do that anyway. I just need to shuffle a bunch of stuff around again.
- I watched two DSA videos on Hashes and took notes

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep going with DSA

#### Notes/Learnings

- Feels weird not to be actively coding, but doing kind of digital housekeeping instead. It's still valuable to my digital life but after working so hard on Shelf it feels so different.

#### To Do

- take down lenniecottrell.com and lenniewritescode.com?
- figure out what I want to do about my blog/portfolio
- ~~get back into DSA~~
- create my walkthough video for google verification
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 95: September 27, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I fixed the route in my app to the privacy page, verified it works in the build, and deployed the new version
- I initiated the other transfer of lenniewritescode.com from GoDaddy to Porkbun. There's no reason to wait for the other domain to complete. Check back in a week.
- I rewatched the DSA video on stacks and queues with arrays and took notes

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

#### Notes/Learnings

- I had trouble getting react-router-dom to link to the right route from `/about`. It wanted to send me to `/about/privacy` and I wanted to go to `/privacy`. Turns out you can just use normal directory navigation and use `<Link to="../privacy" />`

#### To Do

- ~~transfer domain and use it for my github website~~
- take down lenniecottrell.com and lenniewritescode.com
- ~~fix the logo/icon on my blog page~~
- get back into DSA
- create my walkthough video for google verification
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll
- </details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 94: September 26, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started looking into making a super simple privacy policy today so that Google won't show a scary warning when people try to use my app. I'm pretty sure I can say my app doesn't store any information.
- I added the privacy policy page to my app. It was easy, only issue I ran into was a routing problem, I just need to figure that out but it shouldn't be too hard.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Make sure the privacy policy page is working correctly.
- Check on my porkbun domain and transfer the other domain over as well.

#### Notes/Learnings

- I need to make a YOUTUBE VIDEO explaining how my app uses data. So much work. whatever, it'll be worth it I hope.

#### To Do

- transfer domain and use it for my github website
- fix the logo/icon on my blog page
- get back into DSA
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 93: September 22, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I did some research and signed up for Porkbun domain hosting. Seems like its generally well-liked, prices are good, and company is good, and based in the PNW!
- I initiated a transfer of lenniecottrell.com away from weebly and to porkbun. I'll do that one first and then do lenniewritescode once the other one works.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Look into removing the scary google warning
- Watch a new DSA vid?

#### Notes/Learnings

- Even though I didn't really code today, I found a new domain registrar and started moving my stuff around, which is good knowledge/practive for web dev.
- For now I've only moved my lenniecottrell.com account. Once that is complete I'll move lenniewritescode.com

#### To Do

- transfer domain and use it for my github website
- fix the logo/icon on my blog page
- get back into DSA
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 92: September 21, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I deleted my gh-pages branch for my portfolio and retried using the advice from this thread: https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490
  - Specifically, the approach that worked was from _hosja83_
- I got my portfolio site up and running again with an easy way to create new deployments.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Stop hosting on GoDaddy, look into my other domain as well
- Transfer domain registrars?
- use a different domain for my portfolio

#### Notes/Learnings

- Deploying... still a black box. Even to GH pages there's so much happening behind the scenes.

#### To Do

- ~~figure out my portfolio stuff~~
- transfer domain and use it for my github website
- fix the logo/icon on my blog page
- get back into DSA
- ##### Shelf To Do:
- verify the app or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- Make landing page blank?
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 91: September 20, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started looking into verifying my app with google so people don't see the scary "this app isn't verified" screen.
- I read a little about refresh tokens to improve the UX if my users open the app in a new tab
- Turns out my portfolio website was fine (just needed some time maybe?), and I fixed something on my blog page to make sure it worked as well.
- I added the new URL to my portfolio, but ran into some git issues when trying to push

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Figure out the new workflow for pushing my portfolio to github
- cancel hosting with godaddy!
- get the new page to go to lenniewritescode.com or maybe even lenniecottrell.com

#### Notes/Learnings

-Lots of reading today, but that's okay. Sometimes the work of coding is just learning and understanding what needs to be done, rather than always needing to write code.

#### To Do

- figure out my portfolio stuff
- transfer domain and use it for my github website
- verify or otherwise remove the scary google warning for shelf
- get back into DSA
- ~~figure out the MIME type issue with my portfolio~~ _this seems resolved?_
- add a search button instead of live search - maybe cleaner experience?
- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 90: September 19, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I deployed my changes from yesterday, all seems okay
- I kept trying to deploy my new github user site. I noticed I hadn't edited part of my deploy.sh file, that didn't solve it
- Still haven't figured it out. I tried a bunch of different things: adding a gh-pages branch, editing the vite config to point to dist, adding a homepage to package.json, pushing the subtree to git to make sure it points to dist... nothin
- If all else fails I can just make it a project page

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- keep working on this

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- figure out my portfolio stuff
- transfer domain and use it for my github website
- get back into DSA

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 89: September 18, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I successfully preventing the app from crashing if someone isn't logged in and they navigate directly to /library. Haven't deployed it yet because I may try adding some more functionality first.
- I moved my blog page to lenniecottrell.github.io/blog
- I started moving my portfolio site to lenniecottrell.github.io but when I deploy I get the 'disallowed MIME type' error again that seems to happen with Vite pages.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- keep trying to solve this portfolio issue

#### Notes/Learnings

- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll
- get back into DSA

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 88: September 17, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I did all the things on my list today, plus one!
- Pruned BookDetailShelf
- changed token back to sessionStorage instead of localStorage (more annoying if you leave and come back, but now you can only get a fresh token... I hope)
- fixed an issue in the server where books moved to a different shelf wouldn't have their author list formatted
- successfully deployed the new version!

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- ~~look into figure out how to disallow navigating directly to /library~~
- revisit all of my personal website stuff, maybe deploy the new version on GH pages?

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- figure out why the first book in a search gets stuck...
- consider adding a search button instead of live search
- ~~disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)~~
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 87: September 16, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started pruning unnecessary code, and in the process broke something that resulted in my scrapping all the work I did today, so I'm in the same place I started
- This is my fault for working on the main branch! Always create new branches for features >:X
- I did get the toasts to display the right shelf name when a book is moved, and I think I can redo that pretty easily - I don't think that was what broke it

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

Same list as yesterday:

- change the token to sessionStorage instead of localStorage?
- figure out what I can prune from BookDetailShelf
- deploy the new version

#### Notes/Learnings

Don't work off of main when you have a working version!!!!!!!!!

#### To Do

- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- figure out how to expire the token
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 86: September 15, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- With the help of Stack Overflow, I got the "move book" functionality working!

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- change the token to sessionStorage instead of localStorage?
- figure out what I can prune from BookDetailShelf
- deploy the new version

#### Notes/Learnings

- I guess it's bad practice to pass setState functions from parent to child, and the preferred method is to wrap them in a function and pass that function down instead. That solved my problem!

#### To Do

- ~~Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf~~
- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- figure out how to expire the token
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 85: September 14, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I kept working on moving a book from one shelf to another
- Pro: I realized I didn't need a separate route for this, I can just re-use the routes I have
- Con: it does not work yet.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Gotta figure this out! I'm close!

#### Notes/Learnings

- It always has to be harder than you anticipate.

#### To Do

- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- figure out how to expire the token
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 84: September 13, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I worked on moving a book to a different shelf. Seems pretty straightforward - remove the book from the current shelf, add it to the next shelf. The tricky parts are the details though, like sending the right respond and putting everything in one call to the server

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I'm not quite done, so try to get this done tomorrow

#### Notes/Learnings

- 100 Days of code, so far, is the thing that's made me feel most confident in my ability to code

#### To Do

- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- figure out how to expire the token
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 83: September 12, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started working on adding the ability to move a book from one shelf to another... somehow everything broke?
- I successfully added a menu with the options
- I ran into a really weird memory error and now my computer is acting strange :(

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- keep working on this problem

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 82: September 11, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Last night + this morning I moved my personal website from CRA to Vite, and (thankfully) it was easy! After deploying with Fly, I realized that I do not need to be paying GoDaddy so much money for a simple SPA site that I can host for free on GitHub pages, so I'm starting moving things around.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Back to Shelf - add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- Figure out some of the shuffling in my portfolio stuff

#### Notes/Learnings

- As frustrating as deploying is, my understanding of how it works and what needs to be done is better now, enough for me to know that I don't need GoDaddy's hosting service.
- It's fun to feel like I have a more thorough understanding of all of this stuff. Consistency really is key.

#### To Do

- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?
- get back into DSA
- figure out the reshuffling of all of my personal website stuff

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 81: September 10, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I fixed the flashing in MyLibrary, and it was way easier than I thought it would be - I didn't need to use state at all, I just needed to add the spinner with conditional rendering. The initial state of the data was set to `null`, and then it was something like `{!bookList ? <Spinner/> : <Grid>}`
- I also added the spinner to the landing page for consistency.
- redeployed! I now feel confident about publishing this app.
- I added NODE_ENV=production to the fly.toml file also, then redeployed again. ([see here](https://community.fly.io/t/how-to-set-node-env-to-production-when-relying-on-node-buildpack/5612/4))

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I might look into the things on the to-do list, or I might go back to learning about DSA. I've worked hard and got my app to a demo-able place.
- I still need to figure out the disallowed mime-type thing though.... currently it only happens when you refresh MyLibrary ("Loading module was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type (“text/html”).")
  - It seems to be inconsistent. Potentially caused by ad-blocker?

#### Notes/Learnings

- This was a good reminder about conditional rendering. Not everything needs to be a state variable! useEffect was causing the flashing, but the solution didn't involve editing anything about useEffect

#### To Do

- ~~get the modal to show up at the right time~~
- ~~fix flashing in MyLibrary~~
- disallow navigating directly to "/library" (unless logged in?)
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination/infinite scroll?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 80: September 9, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- fixed a bunch of minor styling things like font sizes, responsize sizes, small margin changes, and the background color of a tooltip
- working on changing the modal to show up only on first load, and never if you're already logged in - not done yet
- merged deploy-staging into main on purpose, but forgot that I kept those separate to keep the localHost server calls in main - derp!

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- ~~solve the modal issue~~
- ~~look into the button-can't-be-child-of-a-button warning.~~
- look into fixing the flashing (useRef?)
- set expiration for token value: https://www.sohamkamani.com/javascript/localstorage-with-ttl-expiry/

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- get the modal to show up at the right time
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server (might be fixed by client-side token)
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 79: September 8, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I got fixed the server issue and redeployed. At first it showed me that MIME type error again, but I came back to it later and it worked. It's a little weird that it's inconsistent, but maybe it's some weird cache thing or something

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- investigate the warnings
- make the modal only show if you're not signed in already - now that the token is saved in localStorage, we don't need to see the modal in sessionStorage.

#### Notes/Learnings

- It'll be interesting to see the feedback I get once this is actually released to the general public

#### To Do

- ~~fix the token in prod~~
- ~~deploy~~
- ~~debug deployment~~
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server (might be fixed by client-side token)
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 78: September 7, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I decided to store the auth token client-side, and moved things around to make that work. I think I got everything settled correctly locally, but on my first attempt at mocking prod, there were some issues. I think this will be an okay way to go to make this a viable portfolio project

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- fix the prod issue and actually deploy

#### Notes/Learnings

- I hope this works. I can always build it out futher later and actually add user management.
- If it does work, technically I don't need a server because I could make all the API calls from the client side. I don't know if thats frowned upon though.

#### To Do

- fix the token in prod
- deploy
- debug deployment
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server (might be fixed by client-side token)
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 77: September 6, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I replaced instances of localStorage with sessionStorage to see if that solved the problem of being signed in without access to MyLibrary, I don't think I've done it quite yet. I keep thinking there might be something on the server I need to change but I don't know yet.
- I think something that's happening is that when any user anywhere logs in, the server has that one token. Which means if I'm logged in on my client machine, the publicly available dev server also has access. This is bad.
- This might be useful for the MIME type issue: https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/discussions/8119

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Once I can confidently reproduce every issue I'm seeing, I need to slow down and really think through these problems before jumping in with code.

#### Notes/Learnings

- notes from mentor feedback:
  - idea: netflix but for books? mimic netflix interface - new releases, my list, list by genre, etc just like netflix
  - server should be stateless (i.e. doesn't hold the token)
  - create user session with a cookie
  - gotta figure out how to create user sessions
  - add a timer to the token?

#### To Do:

- figure out how to get the modal to not show up when the page is loaded with an existing token
- figure out why the about page crashes sometimes on refresh (deployment)
- figure out why I get mixed content warnings in prod only
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 76: September 5, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I'm going to try to take copious notes here.
  - localStorage was not the solution to the sign-in flashing, because now it preserve the sign in button state but not the logged in state, so you can access My Library without seeing your books, and the app crashes. I think the solution to this will be sessionStorage, so I'll try that first.
  - It's possible that I'll want to implement the [Visibility API](https://www.igvita.com/2015/11/20/dont-lose-user-and-app-state-use-page-visibility/)
  - I think that building and previewing my vite app while running everything on my server is the closest I'm going to get to simulating production, but there are issues I am having trouble reproducing locally that only happen on prod
  - I need to figure out why loading the /about route crashes the app in prod and gives a warning about a disallowed MIME type. I cannot reproduce this (yet) in dev or staging

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- try out sessionStorage to see if that fixes flashing and the My Library issue.

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- figure out why the about page crashes sometimes on refresh (deployment)
- figure out why I get mixed content warnings in prod only
- ~~figure out how to mock a deployment environment~~
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I finally fixed ONE of my flashing issues! I used localStorage to lok for a value that says the user is logged in to idsplay the right button through reloads.
- I also created a `deploy-staging` branch to make changes between main and deploy-1 and make sure they work as desired. So the workflow now is work on main -> merge with deploy-staging, make sure it works -> merge with deploy-1
- I will need to make sure I am truly mocking the prod environment with deploy-staging

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Figure out why the about page crashes on reload - that doesn't make a lot of sense...
- Make sure calls to google books are https

#### Notes/Learnings

-Deploying is still kind of scary - theres a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that I don't fully understand, so it feels like taking a risk every time I deploy a new version.

#### To Do

- ~~fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing~~
- figure out why the about page crashes sometimes on refresh (deployment)
- figure out how to mock a deployment environment
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

  <summary>Day 74: September 3, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I worked on the sign in flashing to no avail. I committed my changes but I did not merge them to main
- I created a new branch to work on the library flashing, also a challenging one! I don't understand why the setTimeout doesn't work...

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep at these problems for now. Since my app is functional and just has some annoying UI bugs, I could probably try to publish my app as well for more general visibility

#### Notes/Learnings

- The react docs always feel minimally helpful.

#### To Do

- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 73: September 2, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started looking at the flashing when the app is refreshed. I'm really not sure what to do about this, useEffect and useLayoutEffect don't seem to make a difference at all.
- I noticed that I'm still passing state into the Nav bar, I'm going to try to localize state to the Nav component

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- keep working on flashing issues

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- Get feedback from people
- ~~Edit the About page~~
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- Add more results/pagination?
- ~~Add a feedback form?~~

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 72: September 1, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I got some feedback from people and gathered some very, very weird behavior. Both me and a friend experienced being signed in by default (not that weird) and having a book already in our library that nethier of us had ever heard of, and it was the same book! (very, very weird!).
- Other than that, nothing crazy came up, I just need to fix the issues I already know about

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Revisit the flashing issues

#### Notes/Learnings

- The futzing I did with deploying is a little messy - I might want to plan out my version control/branches ahead of time next time I do something like this.

#### To Do

- Get feedback from people
- ~~Edit the About page~~
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- Add a feedback form?

<details>
  <summary>Day 71: August 31, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I deployed! The site is now live on a fly.io docker image.
- I removed a bunch of console logs
- I changed all of my localhost endpoints on the client to just be paths - in prod I don't need the localhost because express is serving the frontend, so it's all on the same port.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I'll get feedback from some people today, and add things to the to-do list! I really want to deal with the flashing issue
- Before I do anything, I need to make sure my development environment is as much like prod as possible, so rebuilding for prod is really easy.

#### Notes/Learnings

- I learned a lot about deploying over the last week or so. Serving a frontend with express.static() makes things pretty easy, and fly.io actually made deploying this site so so simple, thank the lord. I would pay for this service.

#### To Do

- ~~deploy!~~
- Get feedback from people
- Edit the About page
- Get rid of the "headers can't be set after they're sent" warning from the server
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?
- Add the ability to move a book to a different shelf
- Add a feedback form?

<details>
  <summary>Day 70: August 30, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I decided to try out Fly.io to get this project running. I downloaded the fly command line tool, but couldn't get it working on my PATH for some reason. Running the demo app works fine within the bin folder, but I want to be able to create apps elsewhere

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on deploying with Fly, see how far I can get

#### Notes/Learnings

- Gotta remember to stay focused. There are other things to do, but deploying this is my top priority right now

#### To Do

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?
- Add the ability to move to a different shelf

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 69: August 29, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started looking into fly.io which might be a good option if I can't figure out how to get it going on GoDaddy

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep researching how to do this

#### Notes/Learnings

- It became very easy to get distracted with other things, like moving my hosting service away from GoDaddy. I still want to do that, but deploying this app is the first priority. I can do that stuff later.

#### To Do

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 68: August 27, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I added the concurrently package to run the server and the client with the same command, which I think will be helpful here, and fixed a CORS error I was having.
- I looked into trying to host with GoDaddy since I already pay for hosting there. Seems possible, but I'll probably have a number of hurdles to jump.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep looking into deploying with GoDaddy

#### Notes/Learnings

- I'm not sure what I need to do here and I feel like I'm in the middle of the ocean without a lifeboat. This is a completely different knowledge area than programming and it's confusing when you don't have much experience with it.

#### To Do

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 67: August 26, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I took my time to be patient and research the deployment process, and after coming back to some of the resources I opened originally, I understood how to use `express.static()` and gave it a shot. So far that works really well locally! I can serve my vite build with my express server on a single port. Now I need to figure out how to deploy it externally...

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on getting this deployment out. At least I made some nice progress today!

#### Notes/Learnings

- `express.static()` is a great workaround. I'm really happy to know about it and it makes deployment feel simpler now that I understand more about what needs to be done.

#### To Do

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 66: August 25, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Still working on deploying. All I did besides read docs and google stuff was add the 'concurrently' package to the project, which I do think I'll need once I figure out what I need to do to deploy the build

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on deployment

#### Notes/Learnings

- The trouble with this is that I don't understand what needs to happen. Tutorials are useful but rarely explain in generic terms what's going on. When I build locally, the client runs on localhost, but when I build for prod, the files need to be served somehow and I don't actually know how to do that. I need more practice at this specifically.

#### To Do:

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 65: August 24, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I read a bunch of docs and opened a bunch of tabs and attempted to deploy this app unsuccessfully

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on deploying

#### Notes/Learnings

- There has to be a better way. Heroku is always a pain in the butt.

#### To Do

- deploy!
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- Add more results/pagination?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 64: August 23, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I added a couple more checks to account for missing fields in the API call to google.
- I added a little tooltip to explain the cut off description in the book detail shelf
- Started looking into deploying

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Read the Vite docs about building/deploying
- Read the Heroku docs about building/deploying
- Try to deploy a demo

#### Notes/Learnings

- building and deploying is still an area where I have a lot to learn. I feel really comfortable developing locally, but the build/deploy process is still pretty confusing.

#### To Do

- ~~add a cleanData() method to make sure the app doesn't break when there are missing fields~~
- ~~add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions~~
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- deploy!
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 63: August 22, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I successfully added a sort feature to the main search page today. Right now it sorts by year, ingnoring month and day, so I'll need to come back and do that, but I really want to get a demo up so I think I can focus on that now.
- I used this as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4ajd_fINX8&list=PL_kAgwZgMfWx52BOjXE1GSWqN3Wyx13OC&index=4&ab_channel=JasonRivera

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- add a cleanData() method to account for missing fields in the volumeInfo
- research deploying to heroku

#### Notes/Learnings

- keeping this log has been so incredibly helpful - This is a practice I definitely want to carry into all future projects

#### To Do

- add a cleanData() method to make sure the app doesn't break when there are missing fields
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- deploy!
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- ~~Add sorting to the main search page~~
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 62: August 18, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I decided to scrap the alert altogether and just disable the menu if you're not logged in. I tried to add a little tool tip to encourage the user to log in, but the UI/UX seemed messy so I just disabled it. There are already two places where the user is encouraged to log in, I think that's enough feedback.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Try to add the tool tip about the weird google books behavior
- Figure out how to display languages
- Start reading about deploying!

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- ~~change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in~~
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- Get rid of the warning about a button can't be a child of a button (hasn't caused any problems yet though...)
- deploy!
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 61: August 16, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started trying to implement a different alert to match the UI style, haven't figured it out yet.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on the alert style

#### Notes/Learnings

- This is the first Chakra component that doesn't feel straightforward and easy to use, but that may be because I'm trying to put an alert on a modal that already uses the `useDesclosure` methods, and I can't re-use them.

#### To Do

- change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in
- Get rid of the new warning about a button can't be a child of a button
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- deploy!
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

  <summary>Day 60: August 15, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I pretty much finished most of the mobile styles today AFAIK
- I discovered a bug in My Library when there were no authors listed in the results. I fixed it quickly!
- Yesterday (maybe today?) I created a bug in the warning popover where it doesn't dismiss on desktop. It works fine on mobile for some reason, but I should deal with that next, then I can merge this branch into main.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- ~~Fix the popover issue~~
- Fix the alert style if you're not logged in
- Add the little tool tip to the BookDetailShelf component.

#### Notes/Learnings

Now that I know what I'm doing with responsive styles in Chakra, I loooooove it.

#### To Do

- Fix popover issue
- Get rid of the new warning about a button can't be a child of a button
- ~~deal with mobile styles for the detail page(s)~~
- ~~deal with mobile styles for MyLibrary~~
- change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- deploy!
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

  <summary>Day 59: August 14, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Had to skip a day since my in-laws are in town and we had some house projects to do.
- I did some good hard work today and made up for yesterday. I found some great chakraUI templates [here](https://chakra-templates.dev/navigation/navbar) and adapted one to fit my needs to I could collapse the menu.
  - The way they did this was really smart! Instead of needing an if statement, they just used different display styles to hide/show the menu depending on the screen size. Under the hood this uses @media queries with `min-width` but it's a little cleaner with chakra
- I also added link overlays to the collapsed menu so that the whole row is clickable, instead of just the word. Much better UX

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Finish fleshing out the mobile styles - shouldn't be super hard (fingers crosses)

#### Notes/Learnings

- I'm glad those templates exist because I would have been scratching my head quite a lot to figure this out. I also had to do a lot of tweaking to get it to work for me, I didn't just copy/paste. Actually, copy/pasting code pretty much never works, because everyone's codebase is different, and if you don't understand what you're pasting, you'll either introduce some weird side effects or break something outright.

#### To Do

- ~~Figure out how to collapse the nav menu for mobile~~
- Fix popover issue
- Get rid of the new warning about a button can't be a child of a button
- deal with mobile styles for the detail page(s)
- deal with mobile styles for MyLibrary
- change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- deploy!
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 58: August 12, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Started working on mobile styles. Chakra makes it prettty easy, except I'm not sure how to collapse the menu. I might need to go the traditional way with a media query and classnames rather than chakra's built-in system and conditional react

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on mobile styles

#### Notes/Learnings

- Collapsing the nav menu has been the first style related thing that Chakra doesn't make really easy.

#### To Do

- Figure out how to collapse the nav menu for mobile
- deal with mobile styles for the detail page
- change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- deploy!
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 57: August 11, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I moved the style of the search bar from my scss file to a chakra component for consistency's sake
- I removed the search bar from the MyLibrary page. I thought about the value/work of keeping it, and it wasn't worth it. It's unnecessary for a demo app
- I merged into main some work that fixed an issue when removing a book if there's only one on the shelf

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- start working on mobile styling

#### Notes/Learnings

- I only added one new thing to the to do list today, and checked two off.
- I moved sorting lower on the list. I'm anxious to get a demo out, and that can wait

#### To Do

- change alert style if you try to add a book when you're not logged in
- deal with mobile styles
- change the menu to collapse at a certain breakpoint
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- deploy!
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- ~~hide the search bar on MyLibrary~~
- Add sorting to the main search page
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- ~~deal with the final book being removed (again)~~
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 56: August 10, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Today I mostly floundered around trying to fix the flashing issues when the MyLibrary component mounts. I tried using `useLayoutEffect` which didn't seem to make a difference, and I started considering if my architecture is over engineered (do I really _need_ a server?), but I really don't want to have to go back and redesign everything if I can avoid it

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I think I'd like to prioritize getting a demo out, and I can ask for help with the flashing once I have that set up.
- Focus on the final tasks like sorting, mobile styles, hiding the search bar on the my library page

#### Notes/Learnings

- This flashing thing is a real thorn in my side - I thought I had solved it by adding a timeout in `useEffect` when the MyLibrary component loads, but that doesn't actually seem to make a difference. My suspicion now is that the initial state of an empty array is always rendered because of the logic I've written, so I either need to change my logic or change my initial state, or something. It's definitely a timing issue because `useState` is async.

#### To Do

- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- deal with mobile styles
- change the menu to collapse at a certain breakpoint
- hide the search bar on MyLibrary
- Add sorting to the main search page
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 55: August 9, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I dealt with undefined values on the server when the value returned from a shelf is empty
- I read a little about `useLayoutEffect` and tried it out a little to see if it helped flashing. I don't think I fully wrapped my brain around it because it didn't seem to make a difference. I went back to trying to fix it with normal `useEffect`

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I need to fix the flashing on the initial load of the `MyLibrary` component, but the refresh flashing I will move to a lower priority
- work on mobile styles

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- deal with mobile styles
- change the menu to collapse at a certain breakpoint
- hide the search bar on MyLibrary
- Add sorting to the main search page
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 54: August 7, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

I fixed a bunch of minor things today but it really cleaned up the whole experience of the app. I dealt with teh sign-out flow and the state of the sign in/sign out button, and added user feedback so you know if you're signed in or out.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- figure out the multiple authors comma problem when books are removed from MyLibrary

#### Notes/Learnings

-It's amazing how most days I can knock out one major piece of functionality and add two or three things to the two do list at the same time.
-I've said it before I'll say it again - consistency is the key to learning and building.
-I'm excited to finish this, have a project I'm proud of, and get back into DS&A

#### To Do

- deal with mobile styles
- change the menu to collapse at a certain breakpoint
- add the little tool tip about google shortening descriptions
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- Add sorting to the main search page
- hide the search bar on MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh

<details>
  <summary>Day 53: August 6, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

Today I cleaned up the styles of the book detail cards to make them more pleasing to look at

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Fix multiple authors on the BookDetailShelf card
- Deal with the sign out button
- Maybe address some of the flashing issues
- Add sorting?

#### Notes/Learnings

The google books API returns different volume information depending on whether you're authenticated or not. WTF google?

#### To Do

- ~~figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders~~
- ~~handle sign out~~
- add a tooltip to explain the goodle books API behavior
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- Add sorting to the main search page
- ~~Clean up styles~~
- hide the search bar on MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 52: August 5, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I added toasts to indicate success/errors with adding and removing books from shelves, and got the modals to close and lists to update when books are added/removed. I still added three things to the to do list, but this was important progress :D

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I have multiple flashing issues to deal with now, but I'm not going to prioritize that right now (hopefully that doesn't come back to bite me)
- deal with some smaller things on the to-do list to try and pare it down a bit

#### Notes/Learnings

- I tried to fix the issue with the sign-in button flashing on refresh, and I'm gonna push that to the bottom of the to-do list. It's annoying but it's not crucial to the functionality, and I have other things to work on that are more important

#### To Do

- ~~reorder the list of shelves to be consistent with shelfId~~
- figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
- Clean up styles
- Add sorting to the main search page
- hide the search bar on MyLibrary
- preserve the active library tab on refresh
- fix flashing in MyLibrary when adding a first book to ReadingNow
- fix flashing in the sign in button when refreshing
- handle sign out
- ~~close the book detail modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf~~
- ~~close the book detail modal and re-render with a success message when books are added to a shelf~~

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 51: August 4, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started working on the sign-in button state which proved more complicated than conditional rendering.
- I needed to add the authorization flow to another one of my routes which felt innefficient, but it works
- I added a server call to the useToken custom hook to check to see if initial token state exists when the hook is initialized. This solved some flashing issues on navigation, but now I have flashing issues on refresh...

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Fix the flashing issue
- go back to working on what happens in the app after you add/remove a book

#### Notes/Learnings

#### To Do

- fix flashing issue with the sign in button on refresh
- handle search on the library shelves
- handle sign out
- close the book detail modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf
- close the book detail modal and re-render with a success message when books are added to a shelf
- figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
- Add sorting
- Clean up styles

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 50: August 3, 2022 ****</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Woo! I added a bunch of cool stuff today
  - I added session storage to only show the welcome modal on the first time the user visits in a session. This works really well!
  - I restricted the My Library page to only work when the use has already logged in
  - I added a popover to the My Library link that only shows up when the user isn't logged in.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Deal with the sign in button state
- Go back to closing the detail modals

#### Notes/Learnings

- I implemented session storage for the first time today. Pretty straightforward stuff, but always good to try new things
- I am learning a ton about when and how to use the useEffect hook

#### To Do

- Deal with the sign in button state
- close the book detail modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf
- close the book detail modal and re-render with a success message when books are added to a shelf
- figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
- Add sorting
- Clean up styles

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 49: August 2, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started to fix the loading issue by creating a modal that prompts the user to log in. This mostly works
- I need to figure out how to make sure that the app recognizes that the user is logged in when a token exists in the backend already.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on this! I'm close to wrapping up this issue.
- Get the welcome modal to only appear on first load

#### Notes/Learnings

- This has been a good exercise in yak shaving XD I started by trying to remove a book, which meant I needed to re-render some components, which means I needed to move state to a different component, but then it would all just be easier if bookshelves weren't accessible in the first place if you weren't logged in...

#### To Do

- ~~Get the welcome modal to only appear on first load~~
- ~~figure out the log in timing issue~~
- ~~get the app not to break when you click on "my library" when you're not logged in~~
- Deal with the sign in button state
- close the book detail modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf
- close the book detail modal and re-render with a success message when books are added to a shelf
- figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
- ~~add a logged in context?~~
- Add sorting
- Clean up styles

  <summary>Day 48: August 1, 2022 ****</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I successfully fixed the refresh error by loading the token into the API call on the server rather than using a query parameter from the client. This worked really well until I reset everything, and now the library page doesn't load unless you're already signed in, so I need to handle that, but I made a big step from yesterday when I was stuck.
- I cleaned up some components as well - always good to clean as you go

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- once I fix this loading issue I can move on to the next items in my to-do list. I have a sense for what needs to be done to fix it.
- After that, figure out how to close the modal and show a success message when actions are performed

#### Notes/Learnings

- I'm learning a lot about when and how to use `useEffect` and how timing works in React. It feels like a more advanced understanding of what's actually going on under the hood.
- I'm glad I added a backend - it's useful for a number of things and I'm learning more about what I can do with it, like storing information for later and making API calls from the server instead of the client.
- Originally I thought that storing the token on the server would make Context irrelevant, but now I'm using both and I can understand why you might need both.

#### To Do

    - Add routes to the library page to stay on the right page when refreshed
    - Figure out what to do when the token expires

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 47: July 31, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I'm stuck again. I started working on the re-load page issue which led me down a rabbit hole of figuring out where state belongs and where to make API calls and how to fetch token data from my server before the page renders

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Gotta figure this out. How do I get the token data from the server before the component renders?

#### Notes/Learnings

- do I need the tab components if I move the API calls/state to MyLibary?

#### To Do

    - figure out how to refresh the page without crashing the app
    - close the modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf
    - close the modal with a success message when books are added to a shelf
    - figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
    - get the app not to break when you click on "my library" when you're not logged in
    - add a logged in context?
    - Deal with the sign in button state
    - Add sorting
    - Clean up styles

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 46: July 30, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I wrote my backend call to remove a book from a shelf, it works! (after some troubleshooting where I needed to add an empty pair of brackets in the axios call)
- I added a `BookDetailShelf` component to be able to remove a book, and change the button appropriately. I wonder if there's a simpler way to do this?

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- keep working on the close-modal and re-render issue

#### Notes/Learnings

- Programming is an exercise in one-step-forward-two-steps-back. I checked something off in my to do list today, but noticed multiple other things I need to address

#### To Do:

    - close the modal and re-render when books are removed from a shelf
    - close the modal with a success message when books are added to a shelf
    - figure out how to stop multiple authors from adding commas every time the components renders
    - get the app not to break when you click on "my library" when you're not logged in
    - add a logged in context?
    - Deal with the sign in button state
    - Add sorting
    - Clean up styles

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 45: July 29, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I got the "My Library" page working. It now renders books from any of the available shelves!

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- design and add a button to remove a book from a bookshelf - maybe it can go in the bookdetail component somehow? Or make a similar but slightly different version of the book detail component? that's probably easier

#### Notes/Learnings

- To Do:
  - add a logged in context
  - ~~Differentiate between the GET shelf calls in the backend~~
  - remove books from shelves
  - Deal with the sign in button state
  - Add sorting
  - Clean up styles

</details>

### Weeks have kind of broken down... just days from now on

### Week 8 - July 18 - July 20, 2022

#### This week will be short because I'm going on vacation

<details>
  <summary>Day 44: July 20, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

-Opened and closed a PR for the `feature/addToLibrary` branch.

- I added a route to the backend to GET an authenticated user's shelves and successfully returned a book I added via my app
- I added a custom hook to use Context for the Token value. It works, but I still need a deeper understanding of Context

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

-Tomorrow I'll be off the grid! When I get back, focus on rendering the shelves. I need to adapt the CardGrid component for the shelves, but I already have a good idea about how to do it

#### Notes/Learnings

- I found out that currently I can only log in on the landing page. That isn't a problem, but I need to deal with it
- Still to do, in a loose order:
  - Render the shelves
  - Differentiate between the GET shelf calls in the backend
  - remove books from shelves
  - Deal with the sign in button state
  - Add sorting
  - Clean up styles

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 43: July 19, 2022 *****</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I finally got my backend request working, and added a book to my google books library!

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- add the other calls to the other shelves
- Start working on what happens once the backend gets the response

#### Notes/Learnings

- Still to do, in no particular order:
  - Remove books from shelves
  - render the shelves and handle auto updates?
  - add sorting
  - add pagination/load more
  - handle rendering of the sign in button if you're signed in
  - clean up the styles of the book detail page

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 42: July 18, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Changed my API key and reset my .env file so it doesn't get tracked!
- Wrote my basic routes for the backend
- Connected my frontend to the backend and sent request parameters
- Sent basic responses to the frontend

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Make a request from the backend to the google books API and actually send book data to the frontend - I should plan out how that's actually going to work in my app...

#### Notes/Learnings

- Always make sure .env files are in the .gitignore BEFORE you start coding!
- I achieved everything I said I wanted to work on today
- If I had the whole day free I feel like I could make massive progress on this project

</details>

### Week 7 - July 11 -July 17, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 41: July 17, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I missed yesterday but I made it up today with some big progress!
- I figured out how to get the access token I need for the google books api
- I re-wrote my book detail modal to include options for which shelf I needed to add the book do
- I created a backend to store my API key to make authenticated requests

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I need to connect my backend and frontend to send the bookdata to the backend, make the request with the API key, and send the data back to the frontend

#### Notes/Learnings

- The most secure way to store sensitive data in a react app is to store it in a backend and make requests from the backend.
- I made big progress today! I'm getting closer and closer to getting all the pieces together, I can feel it coming

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 40: July 15, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I finally figured out the difference between authorization and authentication - for my purposes I need authorization in my app ising an OAuth implicit flow to get a token for the books API. Actually implementing it is proving challenging, mostly because Google's docs are difficult to navigate. It's hard to tell what's relevant to me and useful

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on this

#### Notes/Learnings

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 39: July 14, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I did a lot of reading about using google authentication and mad a couple of attempt adding it to my app.
- I got the basic user data, but haven't figured out hwo to get a token yet

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Still working on this

#### Notes/Learnings

- The first tutorial I watched used tools that are now deprecated since Google's move to Google Identity Services, so I had to backtrack and start over. I'm trying to just use Google's docs and guides
- The google docs are confusing

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 38: July 13, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I'm still digging into Google Identity Services. I tried using some pre-built stuff from NPM but I can't seem to get the things I need from it, so I keep having to backtrack and learn how to implement it directly. This is probably a good thing in the long run.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on this - I'm going to stick to this goal until I am able to add books to my library

#### Notes/Learnings

- Be patient, be consistent, you'll get there

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 37: July 11, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Did more research/tinkering with google auth - I still think it'll serve my purposes but it's taking a while to know how to implement it correctly. I think I need to use React Context?

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on this

#### Notes/Learnings

- Glad to try a new tool like React Context

</details>

### Week 6 - July 4-July 10, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 36: July 10, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I decided to revisit using google for authentication rather than building my own system and adding stuff to a backend, and I think it'll work fine (I'm trying to do less from scratch this time around)
- I started building out a pretty basic sign-in flow with some npm packages, but as soon as I got it working Google gave me a warning that I was using a soon-to-be-deprecated library and I'd need to upgrade, so I had to backtrack

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep going with this login issue, I don't think it'll take that long actually (...he said ominously)

#### Notes/Learnings

- This round has been less consistent than round 1, but I have a baby coming and I'm trying to spend quality time with my wife before we have the kid, so I don't feel that bad about missing a day. As long as I stay on track with my goals and keep making progress, that's the important part
- I've been reminded that I enjoy the consistency of daily learning/building, and when this is over I would like to build in an hour of learning/building every day even if it's not in the formal structure of #100DaysOfCode

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 35: July 8, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started thinking about how to add things to "My Library" in my book app, and originally I was thinking I could use the Google Books API for that (I think I still can?) but then I thought I might need a database to store everything, so I started looking into MongoDB, and that research was all I really had time for.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep going with Mongo, but also maybe spend some more time deciding if I really actually need to do it this way or not.

#### Notes/Learnings

- I haven't made anything with Mongo or any NoSQL DB yet, so I definitely want to come back to it.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 34: July 7, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I was finally able to select a single book and pass the data to the modal component on a click
- I made the "find in overdrive" link look like a button

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Style the modal and fix the cards
- Add buttons to "add to library"

#### Notes/Learnings

- This was a pretty common and trivial thing to do in React, and I'm glad that my blocker was not my understanding of it, but just a simple syntax error.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 33: July 6, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Turns out the undefined data wasn't my issue (thank god, I felt so dumb), the problem was I had brackets around my mapped JSX, so the map was returning an awrray of undefined. Still feel dumb, but not as dumb because I did actually know what I was doing, I just had a stupid syntax error.
- I watched the videos on doubly linked lists and circular lists, but I will watch them again and take notes

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on selecting a single book

#### Notes/Learnings

</details>

### Week 5 - June 27-July 3, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 32: July 3, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Kept working on reorganizing my API data in react so it's easier to work with
- I refactored a bunch of stuff but I'm still having trouble dealing with undefined data.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- If I have time, keep working on this

#### Notes/Learnings

- Maybe I need to do some react tutorials to review some react concepts...

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 31: July 1, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I jumped back into the book app today. It took a minute to get my brain back in the mode but eventually I got into it again. Daily work will be helpful

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on reorganizing the data to make it easier to use and more "react-like"
- Keep working on dispoalying the data as a selectable card

#### Notes/Learnings

- I'm super stuck on this, and being stuck sucks. I'll keep working at it until I get it.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 30: June 30, 2022***</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I FINALLY REVERSED A LINKED LIST!!!! The problem before was that I wasn't resetting `current` back to the head on subsequent interations, so after the first removal the loop didn't run.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- My parents are in town but I'm still gonna try to get up early to code. Back to the book app, where I'm stuck on another problem. Hopefully coming back to it with fresh eyes will be helpful

#### Notes/Learnings

- I want to write a blog post about this process! I made so many mistakes!

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 29: June 29, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I was able to fix my `removeLast` method enough so that I can successfully reverse a linked list with up to two elements. It doesn't work when I add a third element. WHYYYYYYYYY

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on this problem. If I can't figure it out tomorrow I will ask for help, but I won't look up alternate solutions until I have solved it at least once by myself.

#### Notes/Learnings

- Progress is slow when you have a very limited time each day.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 28: June 28, 2022</summary>
  
 I went to a wedding this past weekend so I took satuday and sunday off, and I just couldn't fit it in on monday, so I'm starting back up Tuesday. This upcoming weekend will also be weird because my aprents are in town - I will try to code in the mornings as usual but might not get to it every day.
 
  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - I'm still working on reversing a linked list - as I was debugging I learned that there were issues with my `removeLast` and `addFirst` methods. I think I successfully debugged and tested `addFirst` but I have more to do with `removeLast`. I'm getting closer though
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - Solve. This. Problem.
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - On leetcode the implementation will have to be different - right now I'm implementing methods as part of the LinkedList class, but I don't know if I can manipulate the class on leetcode.

</details>

### Week 4 - June 19-June 25, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 27: June 24, 2022</summary>
  
  #### Things I accomplished today:
  - I reworked my implementation of the linked list and I got really close to figuring out the right syntax to reverse it, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm close though, and I'm confident that I can come up with my own (brute force) solution before I need to look up answers
  #### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
  - Tomorrow I will be taking a break since I'm going to a wedding. Back to in on Sunday!
  - On sunday I will solve this problem!
  #### Notes/Learnings
  - I did the beginning of this process on paper, which allowed me to think through the problem fully before jumping in to actual code. Now that I'm just struggling with implementation, I think it's better that I'm able to test it in VScode.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 26: June 23, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Back to the book app. I'm struggling with a problem that feels trivial, and all I accomplished today was more struggle

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I try to balance time between working a project and DSA study, but it's hard to be patient with progress when you're stuck on a problem in both realms. I think I might try to go back to reversing a linked list tomorrow, and come back to this problem in my app once I solve that one.

#### Notes/Learnings

- Sometimes I feel like I really understand how to do this work, and sometimes I still feel like a dumb baby. I hope I can get a job as a developer even when there are still times I feel like a dumb baby. Is that the bar for getting a dev job? Not ever feeling like a dumb baby anymore?

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 25: June 22, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I started actually working on reversing a linked list. I have some pseudocode I think will work, I just need to do the hard part of actually implementing it

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I'll keep working away at this problem.

#### Notes/Learnings

- I tried to modularize the implementation of a linked list and an addLast() method and got caught up in the npm requirements of modules, but when I was testing my implementation it was working and I only had to look up one thing
- This will take me a little while, but I really want to figure this out before looking up an answer

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 24: June 21, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I was really tired today and had a busy day, so I didn't accomplish much, but I started thinking about how to reverse a linked list. With the time and mental space I have this week it will probably take me a few days to work out a test solution.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I want to keep working on reversing a linked list
- work on the card if I have time

#### Notes/Learnings

- Must. Not. Criticize. Myself. For. Being. Tired.

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 23: June 20, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I tried to refactor my list component with `map()` instead of creating an array with a for loop, but I ended up breaking it a lot more :(
- On the upside, I submitted two PRs to my company codebase today, so that's pretty exciting, and I think should count towards this project

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on the card grid state
- Start a new linked list problem so I don't let it get stale

#### Notes/Learnings

- This is an annoying problem!!!

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 22: June 19, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I watched a new linked list video about the Iterable interface in Java. I'm not sure if I'll end up using the info from this video because I'm not using Java, but I'm sure that the concept is valuable, and it was the last video before getting into doubly linked lists and circular lists
- I realized that moving my API call did not, in fact, solve my problem of selecting a specific card. I need to figure out how to set the state of the card grid with a "selected" card.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on the grid

#### Notes/Learnings

- This is my first major stumbling block on this project. I hate to be impeded by something that feels so fundamental to React, but I need to remind myself that I'm still learning, people have solved this problem before, and I'll figure it out eventually if I keep at it.

</details>

### Week 3 - June 12-June 18, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 21: June 18, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I realized I didn't know how to get book data into my book detail page, and started thinking I might need Redux for that. After reading a bit about Redux I realized I just needed to move my API call to the book grid component instead.
- I'm actually not 100% sure this solves my problem, but I'm going to work on it for a while to see if I can make it work. Then I'll revisit redux if I can't.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep working on the book detail page

#### Notes/Learnings

- Reading about use cases for redux was helpful before I just dove right in. The idea that planning and preparation is a better approach than just jumping right into the code is sinking deeper and deeper into my awareness as I work on this.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 20: June 17, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I built out the basic skeleton of the book detail page and added it as a modal on the main page

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Keep styling the modal so it looks right and displays the right information

#### Notes/Learnings

- Getting that modal working was way trickier than I thought it would be!
- Don't forget to put the right day in the commit message

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 19: June 16, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I worked through Leetcode 203 with a one pointer and two pointers today to really make sure I knew what was going on, and created a little visual helper for myself with sticky notes.
- I designed and started building the skeleton for a book detail page in my book app

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Build out the book detail page

#### Notes/Learnings

- My main app page is currently rendering twice on initial load - I gotta figure that out.
- Things not to forget about: TDD, Redux

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 18: June 15, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I worked through Leetcode 203 again focusing on understanding each step

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I'm going to keep working on LinkedList problems for now - I'll get to the book app this weekend

#### Notes/Learnings

- It's tedious to work the same problems multiple times, but if the focus is on understanding, I think it's still a good use of my time. I want a deep knowledge of these concepts, and since I'm not in school full time I need to be wrestling with them as much as possible during my limited time I have to study and practice.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 17: June 14, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- worked on leetcode #203
- I wrestled with it for a while before looking at solutions - I'll need to do that for a while as I'm learning, and with limited time I'll have to be patient. However! When I looked at some solutions I was really close

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I want to work through this problem again to review
- I'd really like to not leave the book app for more than a day or two - maybe I can find a time in the middle of the day?

#### Notes/Learnings

- Doing this with limited time is a littel frustrating. Things are going pretty well at work, but my progress with learning/building an app is extra slow since I limited time. I'm leaning in to development opportunities at work, but I'd still like to build out my portfolio and I'd still like to learn DS&A

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 16: June 13, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Reviewed some linked list implementation and started a new problem

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- work on that problem!
- If I have time start working on the book detail page

#### Notes/Learnings

-I like learning

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day 15: June 12, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I built out a login page with Formik and Chakra. Doesn't do anything yet but the basic page is built

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Review Linked List videos and code
- Look at a new Linked List Problem
- Start building a book detail page

#### Notes/Learnings

</details>

### Week 2 - June 5-June 11, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 14: June 11, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Finished leetcode 141, but had to look up the full solution
- Decided to switch my account login from a modal to a separate page
- Did more reading and gathered some more resources on user auth. Beginning to feel a bit like [yak shaving](https://xkcd.com/1739/) -> I need to create a form, okay I can do that with Chakra, but chakra recommends integrating with Formik, okay now I have to read about Formik, plus I have this walkthrough open that I should read to get an overview of the process, and does user auth require React's context API? I need to read about that too...

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Revisit the linked list videos to keep it fresh, maybe start a new problem
- Build out the account page

#### Notes/Learnings

- There was a trick to finding a linked list cycle that I didn't know where a pointer that moves by two and a pointer that moves by one will eventually meet up if there is a cycle. Seems straightforward and I wonder what other kinds of problems there are where I can use that concept
- I looked a bit deeper into using google sign-in and I think it might be ambitious for now. I should focus on building out the rest of the app before adding user auth.
- Refocus: make a book details page, make a way to populate "my library"

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 13: June 10, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I looked at LeetCode #237 on linked lists. I reviewed a couple of solutions after thinking about it for a while and made sure I understood the solutions before moving on.
- Started working on LeetCode #141 also. I got close! my initial attempt passed some of the test cases but didn't pass submission. I'll take one more crack at it before looking up solutions.

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- finish this problem
- keep reading about user auth

#### Notes/Learnings

- I'm very proud of myself for beginning to tackle leetcode questions, and actually starting to feel like I understand the basics of DS&A

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 12: June 9, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- I finished building the "My Library" page when its blank - I think I need to implement user authentication before I can populate shelves? Maybe not....
- Cleaned up some components
- Started studying how another dev implemented user auth on a simple to do app (he used Redux)

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- I want to keep working on this, but I also want to keep picking away at linked lists. I'm gonna do some review and maybe look at a problem
- If I have more time I'll keep studying how to do user authentication

#### Notes/Learnings

- I am feeling very confident with my CSS/Fundamental React skills. I obviously have a ton to learn still, but it's time to start challenging myself to get outside my comfort zone.
- Adding user auth will definitely be a challenge!
- Add redux to this app would also be a very useful challenge

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Day 11: June 8, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- Account login is a modal box for now

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- finish building the "My Library" page
- study how to add authentication

#### Notes/Learnings

- I can't stress enough how important and valuable it is to plan before starting to code. Let this be a lesson I drive deep into my brain.

  <summary>Day 10: June 7, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- did some planning for the next pages of my book app
- Built out the about page
- Researched some components I want to use for the account page and book detail page

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Build the account page and book detail page
- Connect the routes to the new pages

#### Notes/Learnings

- Design choices are hard! There are many different ways a design could go, and planning definitely helps but it's hard to know if you're picking a good UI/UX until you actually start using the thing I think.

  <summary>Day 9: June 6, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- attempted to implement a linked list from memory
- reviewed some of the linked list videos as a refresher

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- don't lose steam on the book app - do some planning

#### Notes/Learnings

- false confidence when you're learning is super real.
- The concept of a linked list isn't hard to understand, but remembering how to implement it in code is more difficult than I expected
- Practice more. Maybe look at some problems and solutions to get more context on how to use a linked list?

  <summary>Day 8: June 5, 2022</summary>

#### Things I accomplished today:

- standardized the card size and position of the images/text on the cards
- used a SimpleGrid instead of normal Grid in ChakraUI to make easy breakpoints for the grid
- added a small hover animation to the cards and a fade in for when they load
- I started making my routes, and I realized I have more planning to do to figure out what the other pages will look like

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

- Start with reviewing what I know about linked lists
- Introduce the next problem in Cracking the Coding Interview
- Work on the plan for the additional pages in my book app

#### Notes/Learnings

- Working in support has made using documentation way easier. Since I reference our own docs and KB at work, I'm used to the language and how it applies Also, since I just know more about code now, implementing things with the docs makes more sense.

### Week 1 - May 29-June 4, 2022

<details>
  <summary>Day 7: June 4, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - learned about remove(), find(), and peek() methods in linked lists
    - populated my book cards with titles, authors, and images

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - try to write out a linked list in javascript from memory and my notes without referencing the one I already wrote
    - make a working branch on the book app so I don't accidentally ruin the good work I've done :)
    - set breakpoints on the grid
    - standardize the title/author text position
    - add a hover animation to the cards
    - add routes to the other pages and start building them

###### Notes/Learnings

    - other future to-dos include publishing to github pages, adding authentication
    - I had to deal with what happens when there are no image links, so that was a interesting edge case to have to work around. It wasn't too tricky, but I didn't expect it

</details>

  <summary>Day 6: June 3, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - I solved the first problem in Cracking the Coding Interview with a brute force method and O(n^2) time. I looked up other more efficient solutions - time to learn about hash tables!
    - I learned how to implement a queue in Javascript
    - I got to spend some hours building my book app UI with ChakraUI and the google books API. It was good practice to fetch API data and display it with useEffect(). I have a kind of clunky solution at the moment, I'll go back and refactor after I clean up the UI a little bit

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - clean the UI so the cards are all the same size
    - consider a different way to display the book data
    - watch another linked list video

###### Notes/Learnings

    - I learned a lot about Chakra UI today, and hot damn using a component library really speeds things up. I don't regret all the time I've spent struggling with CSS, but I'm grateful for a component library that can speed up UI development.

  <summary>Day 5: June 2, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - Researched UI libraries a bit more and devcided to change to ChakraUI, started learning about it
    - Started building my component skeleton
    - Watched 2 more Linked List videos about removeFirst() and removeLast()
    - I started working on the first problem from Cracking the Coding Interview. It's a type of question I've seen before, I just need to remember how to do it.

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - I want to start building the UI at least, if not start to import some data
    - finish this algo problem

###### Notes/Learnings

    - I actually think data structures are super interesting. The videos I'm watching explain everything very clearly and make it seem way easier than I'm sure it is in reality, so I'm excited to start actually applying this stuff to problems.

  <summary>Day 4: June 1, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - I started planning the UI for the book app and made a list of the tools I plan to use

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - Another couple of linked list vids
    - Review the linked list implementation in Javascript

###### Notes/Learnings

    - Planning before coding is good and helpful!

  <summary>Day 3: May 31, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - watched some videos about adding to the beginning or adding to the ending of an array
    - I started reviewing the Google Books API docs
    - I started reading Cracking the Coding Interview to get an idea of what's ahead.

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - start sketching out my plans for a personal library app - what are all the parts and pieces, what does the UI look like?

###### Notes/Learnings

    - I was reminded today as I dove in the deep end of the google books API how much better off I'll be if I spend some time planning before jumping into the code. A solid plan will give me the mental framework and conceptual skeleton I need to be more efficient when I actually start diving in

  <summary>Day 2: May 30, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - I learned about considering boundary conditions in data structures, and adding an element to the beginning of a linked list
    - Reviewed some of the basic of BigO notation
    - I initialized a new app for organizing books using the google boks API

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - more linked list videos
    - dig deeper into the google books API and start building an app

###### Notes/Learnings

    - the 5 boundary conditions for data structures should be considered regardless of the type od structure:
      - what to do if it's empty
      - what to do if there's a single element
      - how to add/remove from the beginning
      - how to add/remove from the end
      - working in the middle

  <summary>Day 1: May 29, 2022</summary>

###### Things I accomplished today:

    - I started learning about linked lists
    - I wrote some code to define a linked list in javascript

###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

    - Watch the next lectures on linked lists from SDSU
    - Start looking at leetcode?

###### Notes/Learnings:

    - Each node in a lists contains a pointer and data
    - List are always complexity O(n) (technically Theta(n)), because each item always needs to be counted and the time it takes to count them increases linearly with the number of items
    - The nodes in a linked list are stored in separate objects that contain pointers to the next objects in the list. This is different from an array, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations (each location being an increment of 4 bytes)
    - Search operations are slow because nodes are accessed sequentially
    - Uses more memory than arrays because of the pointers
    - Nodes can be more easily manipulated than arrays
