  <summary>Day 3: May 31, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - watched some videos about adding to the beginning or adding to the ending of an array
    - I started reviewing the Google Books API docs
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - start sketching out my plans for a personal library app - what are all the parts and pieces, what does the UI look like?
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - I was reminded today as I dove inthe deep end of the google books API how much better off I'll be if I spend some time planning before jumping into the code. A solid plan will give me the mental framework and conceptual skeleton I need to be more efficient when I actually start diving in

  <summary>Day 2: May 30, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I learned about considering boundary conditions in data structures, and adding an element to the beginning of a linked list
    - Reviewed some of the basic of BigO notation
    - I initialized a new app for organizing books using the google boks API
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - more linked list videos
    - dig deeper into the google books API and start building an app
  ###### Notes/Learnings
    - the 5 boundary conditions for data structures should be considered regardless of the type od structure:
      - what to do if it's empty
      - what to do if there's a single element
      - how to add/remove from the beginning
      - how to add/remove from the end
      - working in the middle

  <summary>Day 1: May 29, 2022</summary>

  ###### Things I accomplished today:
    - I started learning about linked lists
    - I wrote some code to define a linked list in javascript
  ###### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:
    - Watch the next lectures on linked lists from SDSU
    - Start looking at leetcode?
  ###### Notes/Learnings:
    - Each node in a lists contains a pointer and data
    - List are always complexity O(n) (technically Theta(n)), because each item always needs to be counted and the time it takes to count them increases linearly with the number of items
    - The nodes in a linked list are stored in separate objects that contain pointers to the next objects in the list. This is different from an array, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations (each location being an increment of 4 bytes)
    - Search operations are slow because nodes are accessed sequentially
    - Uses more memory than arrays because of the pointers
    - Nodes can be more easily manipulated than arrays
